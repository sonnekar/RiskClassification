    "For your context, for the rest of this prompt, when we refer to High Energy Situations, High Energy Incidents, Serious Injury Sustained, and Direct Control present are as follows:\n",
    "Definition of High Energy Situation:\n",
    "High energy refers to situations where the physical forces or hazardous conditions involved are strong enough to greatly increase the likelihood of a serious injury or fatality (SIF). These situations can involve various forms of energy, including gravity, motion, mechanical, electrical, pressure, sound, radiation, biological, chemical, or temperature.\n",
    "The presence of high energy indicates that the conditions pose a significant risk to individuals, typically involving forces or exposures that exceed safe thresholds. For example, situations such as falls from elevation, suspended loads, heavy rotating equipment, explosions, electrical contact exceeding 50 volts, high temperatures above 150°F, or high pressure in excavations over 5 feet deep are typical indicators of high energy, often resulting in severe consequences.\n",
    "Even when exact measurements like voltage or force are not mentioned, hazardous conditions should be evaluated to determine if the risk level suggests the presence of high energy. In such cases, a reasonable inference can be made based on the description of the incident and the potential for serious harm.\n",
    "Definition of High Energy Incident:\n",
    "A high energy incident occurs when a high energy situation results in an actual event, such as an accident, injury, or near-miss. This involves a release of hazardous energy—where the energy changes state or is no longer contained—and the worker comes into contact with or is in proximity to the energy source. Contact means the high energy is transmitted to the body, while proximity refers to the worker being within 6 feet of the hazard with unrestricted egress, or any distance where escape is limited.\n",
    "Definition of a Serious Injury Sustained:\n",
    "Serious Injury Sustained includes work related fatalities and life-threatening and life-altering injuries.\n",
    "Definition of Direct Control Present:\n",
    "Direct controls are: Targeted (the barrier must specifically target a high-energy source), effective: (it must effectively mitigate exposure to the high-energy source when installed, verified, and used properly (i.e., a SIF reasonable should not occur if these conditions are met)) and have human error: (it must be effective even in the presence of unintentional human error during work that is unrelated to the installation of the control)\n",
    "Examples of Direct Controls: [lockout/tagout (LOTO), machine guarding, hard physical barriers, fall protection, cover-ups]\n",
    "Examples that are NOT Direct Controls: [training, warning signs, rules, experience, standard non-specialized personal protective equipment (e.g., hard hats, gloves, boots)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The field notes have the following schema:\n",
    "PNT_NM: Point name, the safety criteria being assessed. Forms a primary key when combined with OBSRVN_NB (observation number)\n",
    "QUALIFIER_TXT: Qualifier text, list of predetermined observations chosen by the reviewer based on the point being assessed\n",
    "PNT_ATRISKNOTES_TX: Point at-risk notes text, comments left by observer regarding unsafe conditions they found\n",
